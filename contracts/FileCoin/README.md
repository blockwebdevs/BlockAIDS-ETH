BlockAIDS is a decentralized ecosystem that harnesses the power of blockchain and web3 technologies to serve millions of
people living with HIV/AIDS and key at-risk populations (e.g. intravenous drug users, members of the LGBTQ community,
commercial sex workers). Utilization of this world-class, secure, and private application restores sovereignty to people
affected by this disease by providing access to records, medications, goods, and services from any place in the world.
Additionally, and equally important, the BlockAIDS community serves as a self-governed platform for enhancing the
product itself, education about managing and preventing the disease, and supporting community initiatives.

We are currently building PledgePositive, an adherence tracker and encouragement platform - a subnet designed to promote
and incentivize healthy behaviors, medication adherence practices, and preventive measures. By utilizing a comprehensive
range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute
to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

For more details on achievements thusfar and PledgePositive specifics, please see the
full [BlockAIDS Summary](../README.md).

## DEMO

This [simple example](./demo) assumes that you're deploying this contract on blockchain and interacting with IPFS for
file storage.

## Usage

- Deploy [smart contract](FilecoinIPFSStorage.sol)
- Go to demo folder, index.js
- Replace 'YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL' with the URL of your Ethereum node, and 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' with your private key.
- Replace 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' with the address where your FilecoinIPFSStorage contract is deployed.
- Update contractAbi with the ABI of your FilecoinIPFSStorage contract. You can obtain this ABI from the contract's
  deployment or Solidity compilation output.
