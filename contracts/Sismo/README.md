BlockAIDS is a decentralized ecosystem that harnesses the power of blockchain and web3 technologies to serve millions of people living with HIV/AIDS and key at-risk populations (e.g. intravenous drug users, members of the LGBTQ community, commercial sex workers). Utilization of this world-class, secure, and private application restores sovereignty to people affected by this disease by providing access to records, medications, goods, and services from any place in the world. Additionally, and equally important, the BlockAIDS community serves as a self-governed platform for enhancing the product itself, education about managing and preventing the disease, and supporting community initiatives.

We are currently building PledgePositive, an adherence tracker and encouragement platform - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors, medication adherence practices, and preventive measures. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

For more details on achievements thusfar and PledgePositive specifics, please see the full [BlockAIDS Summary](/README.md).


## Overview

We are using Sismo as our single sign-on (SSO) solution for patients to securely log into the portal and safely share sensitive medical information.


## Usage

### Data groups

Our goal is to use open data groups to create anonymous but provable membership when interacting with the BlockAIDS application.

We opened a pull request: https://github.com/sismo-core/sismo-hub/pull/2251

To use the data live as an example of proving an address is a member of the group. This can be done using a Vault ID instead, generated through the application in order to fully anonymize the user from any other applications they may participate in.
