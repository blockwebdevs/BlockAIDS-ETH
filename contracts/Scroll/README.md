### Overview

BlockAIDS -  a decentralized electronic ecosystem on the blockchain, that allows millions of people living with HIV and key affected populations (drug users, LGBT, sex workers, etc.) to access their records, medicines, goods and services from any place in the world.

We have now in our ecosystem 19 service centers (physical locations that provide people living with HIV with medicines and services). Our electronic software counts 50k active users and over 1 mln transactions (medical records) only in Moldova. And we are now building a global electronic storage for 5 countries (Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan) and more than 1 million of users.  Our project is supported by international organizations from the UN family, such as UNAIDS.

We are building for our users (people living with HIV and key affected populations) the Loyalty and Reward Electronic System - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV as well as those from high-risk groups such as drug users, LGBT individuals, and sex workers. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.


**Why our team is interested in creating this project**:
We are working with People living with HIV and those from groups at risk for more than 10 Years, by offering them care, support and assistance.
We have currently in our ecosystem:
- 19 medical and service providers centers
- â‰ˆ 250 employees (doctors, therapists, social assistance providers, case managers, researchers, management team, etc.)
- 50k active users and over 1 mln transactions (medical records) in Moldova
- development team in source

### Project Details
We are building for our users (people living with HIV and those from groups at risk) the Loyalty and Reward Electronic System - a network designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV as well as those from high-risk groups such as drug users, LGBT individuals, and sex workers. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

The system incorporates various modules and features to address the specific needs of the target populations:

- Treatment Adherence and Health Management: The system encourages individuals living with HIV to adhere to their treatment plans by providing rewards for consistently taking prescribed medications, attending medical appointments, and undergoing necessary tests and analyses. It includes reminders for medication schedules and tracking mechanisms to monitor progress and achievements.
 
- Preventive Measures: For individuals from high-risk groups, the system emphasizes the importance of preventive measures to reduce the risk of HIV infection. It incentivizes the use of condoms, provides access to sterile needless syringes, and promotes the utilization of social assistance services such as counseling, education programs, and testing facilities.

- Education and Resources: The system features an extensive resource center with educational materials, articles, videos, and interactive tools that provide valuable information on HIV prevention, treatment, and overall health maintenance. Users can earn rewards by actively engaging with these educational resources, empowering them with the knowledge to make informed decisions.

- Support Networks and Community Engagement: The platform facilitates the formation of support networks and communities, enabling individuals to connect with others facing similar challenges. It offers online support groups, forums, and messaging capabilities to foster social connections, exchange experiences, and seek guidance from peers.

- Rewards and Incentives: The loyalty system provides a range of rewards and incentives to motivate and recognize positive behaviors. We want to make the rewards more tangible for users, that's why we need an impact and reward token.
