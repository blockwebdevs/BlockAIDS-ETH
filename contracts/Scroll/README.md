### Overview

BlockAIDS is a decentralized ecosystem that harnesses the power of blockchain and web3 technologies to serve millions of people living with HIV/AIDS and key at-risk populations (e.g. intravenous drug users, members of the LGBTQ community, commercial sex workers). Utilization of this world-class, secure, and private application restores sovereignty to people affected by this disease by providing access to records, medications, goods, and services from any place in the world. Additionally, and equally important, the BlockAIDS community serves as a self-governed platform for enhancing the product itself, education about managing and preventing the disease, and supporting community initiatives.

Our ecosystem currently comprises 19 service centers (physical locations that provide HIV patients with medications and services). In the Republic of Moldova, where the project launched, our software already supports 50K active users and over 1M transactions (medical records). We are now building a global digital storage platform for 5 countries (Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan) and more than 1 million users. BlockAIDS is supported by international organizations and NGOs, such as UNAIDS.

We are currently building PledgePositive, an adherence tracker and encouragement platform - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors, medication adherence practices, and preventive measures. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.


**Why our team is interested in creating this project**:
The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 40 million people across the globe live with HIV/AIDS. In the past decade, however, we've learned that the disease does not have to be a death sentence. Due to breakthrough treatments such as rigorous antiretroviral regimens, combined with regular access to healthcare and prevention knowledge, there is hope. The hope of giving people diagnosed with HIV a chance to lead healthy, fulfilling lives and the hope of slowing the spread of HIV/AIDs is why we're building this platform. 

For more than 10 years, BlockAIDS has been working with people living with HIV/AIDS and with at-risk populations, offering them care, support, and assistance.
To date, we've accomplished the following: 
- 19 medical and service providers centers
- ~250 employees (doctors, therapists, social assistance providers, case managers, researchers, management team, etc.)
- 50K active users and over 1M transactions (medical records) in Moldova
- Development team in source

### Project Details
As mentioned above, we are committed to building PledgePositive, an integral component of the BlockAIDs application designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors and preventive measures for individuals living with HIV as well as those from high-risk groups. This incentivization framework aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

**PledgePositive incorporates various modules and features to address the specific needs of our beneficiary populations:**

- **Treatment Adherence and Health Management:** The primary need we seek to address is adherence to treatment plans by providing rewards for consistently taking prescribed medications, attending medical appointments, and undergoing necessary tests and analyses. This feature includes reminders for medication schedules and tracking mechanisms to monitor progress and achievements.
 
- **Preventive Measures:** For individuals from high-risk groups, PledgePositive emphasizes the importance of preventive measures to reduce the risk of HIV infection. It incentivizes the use of condoms, provides access to sterile needless syringes, and promotes the use of social assistance services such as counseling, education programs, and testing facilities.

- **Education and Resources:** PledgePositive features an extensive resource center with educational materials, articles, videos, and interactive tools that provide valuable information on HIV prevention, treatment, and overall health maintenance. Users can earn rewards by actively engaging with these educational resources, empowering them with the knowledge to make informed decisions along their journey to improved health outcomes.

- **Support Networks & Community Engagement:** PledgePositive facilitates the formation of support networks and communities, forging meaningful connections amongst individuals and/or groups facing similar challenges. It offers online support groups, forums, and messaging capabilities to foster social connections, exchange experiences, and seek guidance from peers.

- **Rewards and Incentives:** PledgePositive provides a range of rewards and incentives to motivate and recognize positive behaviors. To make the rewards more tangible for users, we have created for their usage an impact and reward token.
