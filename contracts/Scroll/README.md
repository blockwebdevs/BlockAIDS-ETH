BlockAIDS is a decentralized ecosystem that harnesses the power of blockchain and web3 technologies to serve millions of people living with HIV/AIDS and key at-risk populations (e.g. intravenous drug users, members of the LGBTQ community, commercial sex workers). Utilization of this world-class, secure, and private application restores sovereignty to people affected by this disease by providing access to records, medications, goods, and services from any place in the world. Additionally, and equally important, the BlockAIDS community serves as a self-governed platform for enhancing the product itself, education about managing and preventing the disease, and supporting community initiatives.

We are currently building PledgePositive, an adherence tracker and encouragement platform - a subnet designed to promote and incentivize healthy behaviors, medication adherence practices, and preventive measures. By utilizing a comprehensive range of rewards and benefits, the system aims to ensure that individuals engage in regular activities that contribute to their overall health, well-being, and the safety of others.

For more details on achievements thusfar and PledgePositive specifics, please see the full [BlockAIDS Summary](../README.md).
